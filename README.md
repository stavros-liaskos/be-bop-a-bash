# Be bop a Bash
My bash configuration for Mac.

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stavros-liaskos/be-bop-a-bash.git && bash ./be-bop-a-bash/install_bash.sh
```

## Info
If you want to get rid of an alias, just use the `unalias` command:
```bash
unalias ll
```
You can list all of your configured aliases by passing the `alias` command without any arguments:
```bash
alias
```


## Todo
Configure aliases to use git-competion as described in the [git-completion comments](https://github.com/git/git/edit/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash)
